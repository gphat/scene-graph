NAME

Scene::Graph - A Two-Dimensional Scene Graph

DESCRIPTION

This is a pure-perl implementation of scene graph.
It allows the creation of scenes of nodes with translations.  The scene may
then be traversed using Scene::Graph::Traverser.  It allows iteration over
a flat array of cloned nodes with all applicable transformations applied.

SYNOPSIS

    use Scene::Graph::Node;
    use Scene::Graph::Traverser;

    my $box = Scene::Graph::Node->new;

    my $thing1 = Scene::Graph::Node->new;
    my $thing2 = Scene::Graph::Node->new;
    $box->add_child($thing1);
    $box->add_child($thing2);

    my $traverser = Scene::Graph::Traverser->new(scene => $thing);
    while(my $node = $traverser->next) {
        # 1st is box, then thing1 and finally thing2
    }
